# remindme

This is a very simple command line tool that
can remind you **in x minutes** or **every x minutes**.

This might not work if you're not using Bash and a Mac.

## How to install it:

*Make sure you have installed python 3*

1. Clone this Repo in ```~```.
2. Add ```source ~/remindme/.remindme.sh``` to your ```.bashrc``` and ```.bash_profile```

## How to use it:

To make remindme remind you once in x minutes, do ```remindme in x```; x must be an integer > 0.
If you want to get reminded every x minutes, use the command ```remindme every x```; x must be an int > 0.
